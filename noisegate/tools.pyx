def shred(

        ):
    '''
    shred - cut an N-dimensional numpy array into a collection of smaller slices, 
    with programmable size and overlap.  
    
    If size and/or step are array-like objects then they must have exactly N
    elements.  If either one is a scalar, it is copied N times.
        
    Limitation
    ----------
     In the current implementation, N must be between 1 and 4.

    Parameters
    ----------
     source : numpy array with 1, 2, 3, or 4 axes
         This is the data to shred.
     size: tuple or list of describing the size of each cutout, in descending
         (...,Y,X) axis order (since it is essentially an index, not a vector).
         
     step: tuple or list of describing the step between cutouts, in descending
         (...,Y,X) axis order (since it is esentially an index, not a vector).

    Returns
    -------
    A 2N-dimensional NDArray with sizes (...,Y,X,...,y,x) (capitals indexing 
    which chunk, lowercase indexing within the chunks)

    unshred - reconstitute a previously-shredded array from the neighborhoods
    that were chopped up.  You have to specify the step size through the 
    output array associated with jumping from chunk to chunk.  This should be
    left over from when you shredded the array earlier.
    
    When a given pixels is present in more than one chunk, unshred can either
    sum (the default) or average (if a flag is set) across the multiple values.
    (NOTE: averaging is not yet implemented, only summing)

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : Numpy array with 2N axes
        A previously-shredded array to recombine
    step : Arraylike 
        Î¤his is the cross-neighborhood stride in the reconstituted array.
        It should contain either one integer (in which case it applies to 
        all the axes) or N integers.
    average : boolean
        If this flag is true, average across pixel values that are duplicated
        in more than one chunk of the shredded array.  Normally, simple summing
        is used -- this requires proper apodization.

    hannify - Apply Hann windows to a broadcast collection of data "cubes"
    
    The Hann window is sin^2, scaled to the size of the window itself.  The 
    sin function is scaled so that the center of the window is unity and the 
    wavelength is the same as the width of the window.
    
    This is used because Hann windows and variants thereof have nice 
    summing properties, so if you choose the right offset between adjacent 
    Hann windows you don't have to do a scaled sum.  This kills two 
    birds with one stone, for the noisegate algorithm:  it provides good 
    apodization and also makes recombining the data better.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source :  Numpy array 
    axis : None or int or list of ints
        This is the axis to which the Hann window should be applied.  if it is

    copy : Boolean (default False)
        Indicates whether the data should be copied before treatment.  if False

    noise_gate_batch - carry out noise gatng on an image sequence contained
    in a 3D numpy array.  Returns the modified array.
    
    The noise gating follows the analysis in the DeForest 2017 paper.
    
    This version tries to lean in to the Cython approach and eschews 
    cubification completely.
    
    Specific algorithmic adjustments are described in the parameters section 
    below
    
    The neighborhood processing strategy uses the identity that 
        sum(x=0,2Ï/3,4Ï/3) sin^4 (x + z) = 1.125
    to merge apodization and recombination.  Neighborhoods are subsampled by
    a factor of 3, and offset-summed to reconstitute the original data.  this
    means that a margin near each boundary of the data set remains apodized.
    The sin^4 comes from *double* apodization: each cube is apodized with a
    normal sin^2 window before the initial Fourier transform; and then apodized 
    again after it is inverse-transformed.  The second apodization minimizes 
    boundary effects from the (potentially radical) adaptive filtering, and 
    results in an overall windowing function of sin^4.
    

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : Numpy array with 3 dimensions
        This is a Numpy array containing the source data.  Only 3 dimensions
        are supported at the moment:  t, y, x.
    pct : float, optional
        The neighborhoods (cubies) in the data are treated as an ensemble, and
        scaled Fourier components are used to estimate noise level.  This is the
        percentile value (across neighborhoods) of each Fourier component, that
        is considered to be a noise level threshold.  The default value of 50
        assumes that most Fourier components are noise dominated in most
        locations of the image.  Lower values should be used for processing less 
        noisy image sets.
    dkpct : float, optional
        This works as pct, but for estimating dark noise.  The default value 
        of 5 assumes that the fifth-percentile value (across neighborhoods) of 
        any given Fourier component can be treated as the dark noise level.
        Dark noise is relevant for the "hybrid" noise model only.
    factor : float, optional
        This is the factor by which a Fourier component magnitude must exceed 
        its corresponding noise-model value, to be retained in the output 
        data.  The default value of 2 keeps approximately 3% of the background
        noise spuriously (2 sigma); this seems to be a good compromise between
        retaining noise and rejecting weak image features, for many applications.
    float dkfactor : TYPE, optional
        This is similar to the 'factor' parameter, but applies to dark noise
        in the hybrid noise model.
    method : string, optional
        This describes the filtering method used to handle neighborhood Fourier
        components that do not rise significantly above the noise model.  
        Accepted values are:
            gate: causes simple gating:  Fourier components that do not 
               significantly exceed the noise floor are explicitly set to 0
            wiener: causes a Wiener filter to be applied, with rollover at the
               significance threshold ('factor' parameter times the noise model).
        The default is 'gate'.
    model : string, optional
        This describes the noise model to be used for the source data. The noise
        model describes how noise is expected to vary as a function of image
        characteristics.  Accepted values are:
            constant: the dominant noise source is considered to be independent
               of image value.  This is suitable for data, such as solar 
               magnetograms or dark-noise-limited images in general, that are
               dominated by an additive noise source independent of image value.
            shot: the dominant noise source is considered to scale like the 
               square root of image value, like Poisson "shot" noise from 
               photon counting
            hybrid: two noise sources are considered:  shot noise, and also a
               dark noise "floor" in dark portions of the image.  This is the
               most commonly applicable model for direct scientific images 
               that are shot noise limited with an APS or CCD detector.
            multiplicative: the dominant noise term is considered to be a 
               constant multiplicative noise source or, equivalently, an 
               additive noise source whose RMS value scales with image value.
        The default is "hybrid".
    cubesize : int, optional
        This is the number of pixels in a neighborhood ('cubie') to be considered
        for a local adaptive filter.  The number must be divisible by 3.  You 
        can specify either a single integer, in which case the neighborhoods are
        cubical, or an array of three values in (t, y, x) order, in which case
        the neighborhoods can have separate size along each axis. For maximum
        noise reduction the neighborhood should be comparable to the maximum
        coherence length in the data.  For data that include rapidly moving
        features which do not, themselves, evolve rapidly, you should consider
        matching the t size to the x and y sizes, based on the expected speed
        of the features.
    cubediv int, optional
        This is the fraction of a neighborhood size to step between neighborhoods
        when processing.  3 gives 2/3 overlap between neighborhoods in all 
        axes, 6 gives 5/6 overlap.
    subsamp : int, optional
        This allows the noise-spectrum estimator to subsample the cubies data 
        by the specified factor along each axis, saving computing time. The 
        default is 2, which reduces the number of Fourier transforms for this 
        step by a factor of 8.  
    spectrum : dictionary, optional
        If present, this should be a dictionary returned by get_noise_spectrum.
        If not present, a new noise spectrum is calculated for this batch.  
        Since the noise spectrum model is constant for each instrument 
        configuration, there is no nead to recalculate the spectrum for 
        different batches processed as part of a larger data set; this
        parameter lets you explicitly calculate a spectrum first, then call
        noise_gate_batch multiple times to process a data set too large to 
        fit in memory simultaneously.
    vignette : numpy 2-D array or none
        If supplied, this is a vignetting function of the instrument. The data
        are assumed to be already corrected for vignetting, so they are scaled 
        by the vignetting function before processing, then it is removed after
        processing.  This produces better uniformity of noise characeristics in,
        e.g., coronagraphs that use vignetting to reduce detector dynamic range.

    A numpy array matching the source array, containing the cleaned-up data.
